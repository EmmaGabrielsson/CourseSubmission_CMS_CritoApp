# CourseSubmission CMS - Crito Website

This is my Git repository for the individual assignment where I built a website for the fictional company Crito. I used the design file as a reference, which I opened with [Figpea](https://figpea.com/). I also used Umbraco CMS to create the website.

## Assignment Requirements

To meet the assignment requirements, I accomplished the following tasks:

- **Umbraco CMS Setup:** I successfully set up Umbraco CMS to manage the website's content.

- **Static Components:** I created all the components mentioned in the design file as static/hardcoded elements on the website at first.

- **Form Handling:** I implemented form handling on the website, ensuring that data is validated when users submit information.

To excel in this assignment, I went beyond the passing requirements by:

- **Document Types and Compositions:** I applied document types, compositions, and other Umbraco features as needed for each part mentioned in the design file, ensuring a more dynamic and maintainable website.

- **Dynamic Navigation:** I implemented a dynamic navigation system to enhance the user experience.

- **Dynamic Content:** I made the News/Blog/Article sections dynamic and editable, allowing for easy content updates. Additionally, almost every part of the project is dynamic and has editable content.

- **Database Integration:** I set up a local SQL Server database to store form submission data, ensuring data persistence and retrieval.
